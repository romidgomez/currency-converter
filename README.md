## :star: Currency converter

This web-based currency converter makes it extremely easy for you to convert currencies! Just input the amount you'd like you convert to/from and the source and target currency. This converter only accepts numbers, naturally, so you'll get promt with an error message if you try to input any non-numerical character.

## About project

I started this project as an assignment with a time limit of 4 hours. Before diving into the code, I thought of many ways I could build this app, but ended up using the stack I'm most comfortable with to move as quickly as possible. I kept a minimal folder structure taking into concideration the size of the project, and didn't use packages/extension I'd normally use (Redux, Sass, etc..) as I concidered it would've been an overkill. As one normally does when working with a short timeframe, there's a million thing's I would've loved adding to this currency converter, like little flag-icons for each currency option, or the ability to have several convertions at the same time, but all in all, I'm very happy with the result! Enjoy!
